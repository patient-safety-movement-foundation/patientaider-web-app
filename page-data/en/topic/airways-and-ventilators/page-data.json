This process is called intubation. The airway is attached to a ventilator (breathing machine).[^144]\n\nThere are 2 kinds of artificial airways:\n\n- An endotracheal tube is placed in the windpipe (trachea) by going through the mouth or nose.\n- A tracheostomy tube is connected to a surgical hole in the neck.[^144]\n\nMonitors measure the heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure and oxygen level. It is recommended that the exhaled carbon dioxide level (ETCO2) is measured by capnography. Normal ETCO2 range is 35-40 mmHg.[^145]\n\nCommunicating with the patient is much more difficult, because the patient can’t speak unless they have a tracheostomy tube with a speaking valve. Having an airway can cause anxiety, fear and discomfort for a patient.[^146]\n\n### Patients can communicate by:[^146]\n\n- Writing on paper\n- Nodding or shaking head\n- Using hand or facial gestures\n- Pointing to letters, pictures or phrases on paper or a board\n- Texting\n- [Patient Communicator mobile app from SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/MyICUCare/THRIVE/Patient-and-Family-Resources/Patient-and-Family \"Patient Communicator mobile app from SCCM\")\n\n### Alert the nurse if:\n\n- The airway comes out\n- The patient’s monitor alarms go off\n- Increased breathing difficulty\n- Changes in breathing\n- The patient looks worse\n- The airway doesn’t look or sound right\n- Increased confusion\n\n### Complications for patients on ventilators:[^147][^148]\n\n- Ventilator-associated pneumonia\n- Sepsis\n- Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)\n- Pulmonary Embolism\n- Lung damage\n- Pulmonary edema\n- Fluid overload\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/L1CRAruWMVE\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/L1CRAruWMVE</a>\n\n### Prevention of Ventilator complications:[^68][^74][^75][^147][^148]\n\n __Use the Hospital Plan of Care form to advocate and ask questions about your loved one.__\n\n[The Hospital Plan of Care form](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/POC-Blank-April-19.pdf \"The Hospital Plan of Care form\")\n\n[Guide to Medical Care at a Distance](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Guide-to-Medical-Care-at-a-Distance.pdf \"Guide to Medical Care at a Distance\")\n\n- Help to make sure the patient's back and head are always more than a 30 degree angle.\n- When can the patient breathe on their own?\n- When can the sedation medication be reduced?\n- When can the patient get out of bed & move around?\n- Tell the nurse if the patient slides down in the bed.\n- Does the patient have pressure sores on their back and/or buttocks?\n- Can the patient have a subglottic secretion drainage endotracheal tube if the ventilator will be in more than 72 hours?\n- Are the patient's teeth &/or dentures being cleaned twice a day?\n- Is the patient's mouth being rinsed with a non-alcohol based mouth rinse?\n- If the patient is at risk for aspiration will their teeth & mouth be cleaned 2-4 times a day with a suction toothbrush kit?\n- Is the patient being suctioned every 4 hours? \n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4rFjAmaDXlg.\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/4rFjAmaDXlg.</a>\n\n- Is everyone that sees the patient washing their hands?\n- Wash your hands, especially after using the bathroom.\n- Does the patient have a fever?\n- Is the patient feeling sick to their stomach?\n- Is the patient feeling sudden pain?\n- Does the patient have redness, swelling or tenderness at the airway insertion site?\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hNo808Nx0bs\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/hNo808Nx0bs</a>\n\n1\\.
