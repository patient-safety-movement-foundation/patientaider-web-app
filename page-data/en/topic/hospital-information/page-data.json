ED doctors can‘t see all the patients at the same time. That is why the Triage process is used.\n\n## Triage\n\nPatients are given a Triage level by a Triage RN based on their illness or injury. The Triage RN does a brief history and assessment to decide what Triage level the patient is. Most hospitals use 5 Triage levels.\n\nTriage levels[^1]:\n\n- Resuscitation\n- Emergent\n- Urgent\n- Less Urgent\n- Non-urgent\n\nShow the nurse or doctor a healthy photo of your loved one or yourself. They can compare this with how the patient looks now. Tell the nurse or doctor how the patient normally acts and the differences now. \n\n[Emergency Room Fact Sheet from the Empowered Patient Coalition and Leah's Legacy](http://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/emergency_room_fact_sheet.pdf)\n\n[Your Hospital Survival Guide from Consumer Reports](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/10/your-hospital-survival-guide/index.htm)\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/EpeAVbESKIY\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/EpeAVbESKIY</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/D_vRYhEKAKA\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/D_vRYhEKAKA</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/XIsWr2W9QEw\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://m.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=XIsWr2W9QEw</a>\n\n[^1]: U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
