These rounds serve as a coordination plan to ensure the best patient care and involvement. \n\n## What do daily Healthcare Team rounds look like? \n\n- Rounds should be at the same time each day, so that families can be there \n- Everyone should be prepared, on time, and present \n\n### What should be discussed?\n\nWhile each team member will have different talking points, the following should almost always be addressed by someone:\n\n- Plan of care\n- Goals of care\n- Expected length of stay\n- Expected outcomes for the day \n- Discharge plan\n- Delays or challenges\n- Patient progress\n- Issues related to the family\n- Changes in care\n- Any insurance barriers related to discharge\n- Pending insurance approvals\n- Behavioral health service assessment\n- Community referral status\n\n### Why are Healthcare Team rounds beneficial? \n\nThese rounds can ensure that the patient and family members are on the same page as their hospital team to: \n\n- Improve teamwork \n- Improve communication\n- Reduce replication & redundancy\n- Improve patient experience\n- Reduce errors\n- Optimize discharge & post-hospitalization care\n- Increase satisfaction among all team members\n\n### How can patients and family members participate?\n\n- Ask questions \n- Voice concerns & comments\n- Write down goals, concerns, & questions before rounds\n\n __Use the Hospital Plan of Care form to advocate and ask questions about your loved one.__\n\n[The Hospital Plan of Care form](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/POC-Blank-April-19.pdf \"The Hospital Plan of Care form\")\n\n[Guide to Medical Care at a Distance](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Guide-to-Medical-Care-at-a-Distance.pdf \"Guide to Medical Care at a Distance\")\n\n### Why is patient and family participation important? \n\nThis family involvement should be present in every moment while in the hospital. Family members know what __“normal”__ looks like for their loved one. The Healthcare Team does not know the patient like the family does. \n\nWhile the team may be exceptional, your voice adds an important, unique element to the Healthcare Team rounds. Patient and family participation can prevent errors, improve patient comfort, and help in understanding of the patient.\n\n## Healthcare Team\n\n### Doctors\n\n- __Hospitalist:__ A medical doctor who only cares for patients in a hospital.\n- __Attending Physician:__ A medical doctor in charge of and responsible for your care.\n- __Fellow:__ A medical doctor training to be a specialist and has completed a residency program.\n- __Resident:__ A medical doctor who practices medicine under the attending doctor and has completed the first year (intern) of a residency program.\n- __Intern:__ A medical doctor who is in the first year of a residency program.\n\n### Nurses, Nurse Practitioners and Assistants\n\n- __Nurse Manager:__ Manages the floor or unit’s daily operations.\n- __Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant:__ Practices medicine under the supervision of a doctor.
