Getting a patient out of bed safely to a standing position, a chair, and walking are ways to do this. [^98]\n\n## Questions to Ask:\n- What is the patient's baseline mobility? \n- Does the patient have redness on their boney areas: heels, lower back,       ankles, &/or hips?\n- Has the patient's mobility improved, gotten worse, or stayed the same?\n- What equipment is used to help the patient?\n- How often are mobility assessments done?\n- Is the patient at risk for a fall?\n- Do you see any balance, stability, &/or fatigue problems? \n- Are there problems with the equipment?\n- What is the patient's mobility plan? Will it change after discharge?\n- What are the patient's goals after discharge home?\n- What equipment will the patient need for discharge?\n- What are the mobility barriers for the patient after discharge?\n\n## Equipment for Mobility:\n- Walkers\n- Canes\n- Wheelchairs\n- Gait belts\n- Lift chairs\n- Adjustable beds\n- Rollaters\n\n __Use the Hospital Plan of Care form to advocate and ask questions about your loved one.__\n\n[The Hospital Plan of Care form](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/POC-Blank-April-19.pdf \"The Hospital Plan of Care form\")\n\n[Guide to Medical Care at a Distance](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Guide-to-Medical-Care-at-a-Distance.pdf \"Guide to Medical Care at a Distance\")\n\n## Fall Prevention\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MhPFCRLevY0\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/MhPFCRLevY0</a>\n\n1.  Have someone with the patient 24/7. Don’t leave the patient alone if they are at risk for a fall\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GvX0AYUqeI0?list=LL31GglpqkW9B1NW8eHUZ-CA\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/GvX0AYUqeI0?list=LL31GglpqkW9B1NW8eHUZ-CA</a>\n\n[Fall Information by the National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/falls.html)\n\n2. Call for help before getting out of bed. Use your call light. __Don’t walk if you feel dizzy, sleepy or not yourself.__  [^7]\n\n![Call light](//images.ctfassets.net/xbvvg00rroa3/4CdrMBsvYQemEkGW06AAqk/6bf5524a457e19aba2aeff90f846e5cc/Call_light.jpg)\n\n3. Mobilize the patient safely as soon as the doctor permits. Wear non-slip slippers or shoes that fit well. Clear obstacles in the room if you or your loved one wants to walk to the bathroom. Make sure an assistive device like a walker or cane is available for the patient to use if needed.[^7]\n\n![walkers](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/114266/file-16410688-png/images/c--documents_and_settings-ninar-desktop-walkers_and_assistive_devices_sm.png)\n\n4. Take off your slippers worn over socks before getting back to bed, since they can pick up germs on the floor.[^7]\n\n[Making the World Safer for Senior Citizens by Senior Living](https://www.seniorliving.org/research/injury-prevention-guide/ \"Making the World Safer for Senior Citizens by Senior Living\")\n\n[^7]: Hallisey J.
