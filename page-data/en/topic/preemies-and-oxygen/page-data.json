They may need extra oxygen to reach normal levels of oxygen in their blood.[^176][^177][^178][^179][^180][^175][^181]\n\nSupplemental oxygen helps prevent hypoxia, but too much oxygen (hyperoxia) can cause retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), cancer, lung disease, developmental disabilities, infection, inflammation, fibrosis, and other health conditions.[^176][^177][^178][^179][^180][^175][^181]\n\nPreterm babies have less antioxidants and immature lungs which can increase the harmful effects of oxygen.[^176][^177][^178][^179][^180][^175][^181]\n\n![Preemie pulse oximeter](//images.ctfassets.net/xbvvg00rroa3/5iizL3bwVOOMwSsqkgMyeu/b0f40853f5b45443e7864b5cbaf2551c/Preemie_pulse_oximeter.jpg)\n\n![Pulse Oximeter](//images.ctfassets.net/xbvvg00rroa3/62HmzU3IeA4QugCgOKEKKw/267477dfe9966f5d1053a8ae68e08060/Pulse_Oximeter.jpg)\n\nPulse oximeter alarms need to be on when a preterm baby is receiving supplemental oxygen. Manually monitoring a preterm baby on supplemental oxygen is not as accurate as a pulse oximeter with alarms.[^182][^183]\n\nWhen the SpO2 level goes below 95% giving too much oxygen at once should be avoided, which will bring the baby’s SpO2 over 95%.[^182]\n\nPrevention of hypoxia & hyperoxia[^177][^178][^179][^180][^182][^183][^184][^185][^181]:\n\n- Accurate oxygen level assessment by continuous pulse oximetry with alarms\n- Continuous oxygen monitoring to maintain SpO2 range above 91% and below 95%\n- Supplemental oxygen given when the preterm baby is on continuous pulse oximetry with alarms\n- Decreasing unnecessary supplemental oxygen unless needed\n\n __Use the Hospital Plan of Care form to advocate and ask questions about your loved one.__\n\n[The Hospital Plan of Care form](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/POC-Blank-April-19.pdf \"The Hospital Plan of Care form\")\n\n[Guide to Medical Care at a Distance](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Guide-to-Medical-Care-at-a-Distance.pdf \"Guide to Medical Care at a Distance\")\n\n[Oxygen Therapy for Infants from the U.S. National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007242.htm)\n\n[Premature Baby Information from the U.S. National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/prematurebabies.html)\n\n[Retinopathy of Prematurity Information from the U.S. National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001618.htm)\n\n[Tips to Survive Your Child's Hospital Stay from Parents.com](http://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/advice/tips-to-survive-your-childs-hospital-stay/)\n\n[^175]: Di Fiore J, Bloom JN, Orge F, et al.
