Hand washing, clean water, sanitation and nutrition can’t prevent all infectious diseases, especially germs in the air.[^83]\n\nGetting these diseases can cause serious complications like paralysis, birth defects, liver cancer, pneumonia and death.[^83]\n\nBabies and young children aren’t able to fight these diseases because of their immature immune systems. They will be protected from these diseases by vaccinations before they get them.[^83]\n\nAdults are at risk from infectious diseases because of age, health conditions like diabetes, lifestyles and travel.[^83]\n\nProtect yourselves, loved ones and your community by being up-to-date with the recommended vaccinations. Ask your healthcare provider about your vaccinations.[^83]\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mLHnUjhzv9E\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/mLHnUjhzv9E</a>\n\n[Vaccination Information from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services](https://www.vaccines.gov/index.html)\n\n[Vaccines for Infants, Children, and Teens from U.S Department Health & Human Services](https://www.vaccines.gov/who_and_when/infants_to_teens/index.html)\n\n[Vaccines for Adults from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services](https://www.vaccines.gov/who_and_when/adults/index.html)\n\n[Vaccines for Pregnant Women from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services](https://www.vaccines.gov/who_and_when/pregnant/index.html)\n\n[^83]: U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
