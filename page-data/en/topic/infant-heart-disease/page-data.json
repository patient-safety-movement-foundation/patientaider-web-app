One of four babies born with a congenital heart defect has CCHD.[^166][^167][^168][^165]\n\nAbout 30% of CCHD deaths are from a missed or a late diagnosis.[^170]\n\nPulse oximetry is the screening test for CCHD[^171][^172]. This painless, non-invasive test tells how much oxygen is in the baby’s blood. It is done when the baby is 24 hour old or before discharge from the hospital.[^171][^172]\n\nIf the baby's pulse oximetry screening result is less than 90% in both the right hand & foot, follow-up testing is done.[^172]\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GZfdM93ALZo\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/GZfdM93ALZo</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/pdtVk3hqmBM\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/pdtVk3hqmBM</a>\n\n __Use the Hospital Plan of Care form to advocate and ask questions about your loved one.__\n\n[The Hospital Plan of Care form](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/POC-Blank-April-19.pdf \"The Hospital Plan of Care form\")\n\n[Guide to Medical Care at a Distance](https://patientsafetymovement.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Guide-to-Medical-Care-at-a-Distance.pdf \"Guide to Medical Care at a Distance\")\n\n[5 Things You Need to Know About Congenital Heart Disease from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/heartdefects/documents/5ThingsCHD.pdf)\n\n[Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Disease from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/heartdefects/documents/ncbddd_birth-defects_cchd-newborn-screening.pdf)\n\n[Newborn Screening Information from Baby's First Test](http://www.babysfirsttest.org)\n\n[Tips to Survive Your Child's Hospital Stay from Parents.com](http://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/advice/tips-to-survive-your-childs-hospital-stay/)\n\n[^165]: Hoffman J, Kaplan S.
